	<p class="cognex-content-p">Hotbars is a significant innovation in the fundamental image analysis methods used to read barcodes. The result of a two-year R&D effort led by Cognex cofounder Bill Silver, Hotbars technology combines with Cognex-led advances in image formation to enable DataMan ID readers to outperform traditional laser scanners in the most demanding applications:</p>
		<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; material handling</p>
		<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; logistics</p>
		<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; electronics</p>
		<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; food/beverage</p>
		<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; consumer goods</p>
		<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; automotive</p>

	<p class="cognex-content-p">In this presentation, Bill describes how Hotbars finds barcodes in a scene and extracts one-dimensional signals for decoding. He also discusses the performance of Hotbars, with particular emphasis on significant improvements in resolution and speed, as well as the implications of these innovations for the future of barcode reading.</p>

<div id="Multiple">
	<h4 class="cognex-content-title">Multiple Code Reading Made Easy</h4>
	<p class="cognex-content-p">The primary way we solve ID applications is to provide hardware and algorithms that achieve the highest read rates. But beyond reading, Cognex focuses on finding other ways to make your life easier. One application we can help with is reading multiple codes more easily with our DataMan® family of industrial ID readers.<p class="cognex-content-p">

	<p class="cognex-content-p">Our expert presenter will discuss how to easily solve applications that read:</p>
	<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; Multiple codes of the same symbology within one field of view (FOV)</p>
	<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; Multiple codes of mixed symbologies within one FOV</p>
	<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; One or more codes on multiple sides to verify that codes match</p>
	<p class="indent cognex-content-p">&bull; One or more codes on multiple sides to output both sides' read results as one</p>
